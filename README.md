# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player strategy game reimagined with a modern, interactive web-based design. Built with both fun and functionality in mind, this project aims to deliver an engaging experience suitable for both children and adults. The game features a responsive and animated 3x3 grid where players take turns placing their symbols (X or O) with the goal of getting three in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

To keep things exciting, the game supports multiple modes, including:

👥 Player vs Player (local multiplayer)

🤖 Player vs AI with three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard (using the Minimax algorithm)

✨ The game also includes modern UI/UX enhancements such as:

Animated transitions and symbol placement

Light/Dark mode toggle

Fun skins and emoji-based themes

Sound effects with mute toggle

Score tracking and win/draw/loss stats using localStorage

Additional features like mini challenges, unlockable themes, 4x4 and 5x5 game variants, and fun elements like “Drunk Mode” or random trivia make the game even more engaging.

For tech-savvy users, optional real-time online multiplayer using WebSockets (Socket.io) or Firebase is also supported.

📱 The website is fully responsive, accessible, and mobile-friendly. 🧠 Includes a rules/instructions section and optional user profile setup for a personalized experience.
